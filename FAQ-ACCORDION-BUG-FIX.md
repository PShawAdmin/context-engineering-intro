# FAQ Accordion Bug Fix Summary

## Issue
The "What is your cancellation policy?" FAQ item (and potentially others) was not expanding when clicked.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the controlled state implementation for the accordion. HeroUI accordions can have conflicts when using controlled state (`selectedKeys` and `onSelectionChange`) especially when combined with dynamic filtering.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed Controlled State**: Switched from controlled accordion (with `selectedKeys` and `onSelectionChange`) to uncontrolled accordion with `defaultExpandedKeys`
2. **Simplified State Management**: Removed the complex `expandedKeys` state and handler logic
3. **Cleaned Up Debug Code**: Removed all console.log statements and debug handlers

## Final Implementation
```typescript
<Accordion 
  variant="bordered"
  selectionMode="multiple"
  defaultExpandedKeys={["1"]}  // Optional: pre-expand first item
  className="mb-12"
>
```

## Why This Works
- Uncontrolled accordions handle their own state internally
- No conflicts between filtering and expansion state
- HeroUI manages click events and animations properly
- Each accordion item can expand/collapse independently

## Trade-offs
- Lost ability to programmatically control which items are expanded
- Cannot implement "expand all/collapse all" functionality
- But gained: reliable click handling and simpler code

## Testing Results
- ✅ All FAQ items now expand/collapse on click
- ✅ Filter tabs work correctly
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
