# FAQ Accordion Audit & Optimization Plan

## Current Issues
1. **Accordion Not Expanding**: FAQ items don't expand when clicked
2. **Filter Bar Malfunction**: Category filter tabs are not functioning properly

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Component Dependencies Audit
- [ ] Verify HeroUI package versions in `package.json`
- [ ] Check for version conflicts between HeroUI components
- [ ] Ensure all required HeroUI providers are properly configured
- [ ] Verify NextUI/HeroUI theme configuration in the app

### 2. State Management Review
- [ ] Inspect React state handling for accordion selection
- [ ] Check if `selectionMode="multiple"` is properly implemented
- [ ] Verify state updates are triggering re-renders
- [ ] Review filter state management and tab selection logic

### 3. Event Handler Analysis
- [ ] Check onClick/onPress event handlers on accordion items
- [ ] Verify event propagation isn't being blocked
- [ ] Inspect any custom event handlers that might interfere
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation (Enter/Space keys)

### 4. CSS & Styling Conflicts
- [ ] Look for CSS that might be preventing click events
- [ ] Check z-index issues with overlapping elements
- [ ] Verify pointer-events are not disabled
- [ ] Inspect for conflicting Tailwind classes

### 5. JavaScript Console Errors
- [ ] Check browser console for runtime errors
- [ ] Look for missing dependencies or imports
- [ ] Verify no hydration mismatches (Next.js SSR issue)
- [ ] Check for any blocked scripts or resources

## Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes
1. **Debug Accordion Functionality**
   - Add console logs to track click events
   - Verify HeroUI Accordion API usage matches documentation
   - Test with minimal example to isolate issue
   - Check for required wrapper components

2. **Fix Filter Bar**
   - Verify Tabs component implementation
   - Check selected tab state updates
   - Ensure filtered FAQ items render correctly
   - Test tab keyboard navigation

### Phase 2: Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Performance Improvements**
   - Implement lazy loading for FAQ content
   - Add search functionality for quick FAQ lookup
   - Optimize re-renders with React.memo
   - Consider virtual scrolling for large FAQ lists

2. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Ensure ARIA labels are properly set
   - Test with screen readers
   - Add focus indicators for keyboard navigation
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy

3. **User Experience Upgrades**
   - Add expand/collapse all button
   - Implement smooth scroll to expanded item
   - Add copy-to-clipboard for FAQ answers
   - Include "Was this helpful?" feedback option

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Verify mobile responsiveness
   - Check touch interactions on mobile devices

2. **Automated Tests**
   - Write unit tests for accordion functionality
   - Add integration tests for filter behavior
   - Create e2e tests for user workflows

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Review `/app/(marketing)/faq/page.tsx` for syntax errors
- [ ] Check HeroUI imports and component usage
- [ ] Verify all required props are passed to components
- [ ] Test in development environment with console open
- [ ] Compare with HeroUI documentation examples

### Debug Steps
```typescript
// Add these debug points:
1. In handleSelectionChange - log selected keys
2. In filter function - log filtered results
3. In AccordionItem onClick - verify event fires
4. In Tabs onSelectionChange - log selected tab
```

### Quick Fix Attempts
1. Update HeroUI packages to latest stable version
2. Clear Next.js cache and rebuild
3. Check for conflicting global styles
4. Verify client-side rendering with 'use client' directive
5. Test with simplified FAQ data set

## Expected Outcomes
- Accordion items expand/collapse on click
- Filter tabs properly filter FAQ categories
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- No console errors or warnings

## Success Metrics
- All FAQ items are clickable and expandable
- Filter reduces visible FAQs to selected category
- Page loads without JavaScript errors
- Lighthouse accessibility score > 95
- User can navigate entirely with keyboard

## Timeline
